# Hangman-mit6.0001
Hangman game (without-hints)

This is an interactive game that asks the user to guess all the letters in a word that the computer chooses at random. The player starts with 3 warnings and 6 guesses. They 1 a warning when they play a character that is not an alphabet or when they play an alphabet character that they already chose. Once they have lost all three warnings they lose 1 guess. They lose 1 one guess if they guess a consonant -not a, e, i, o, u- that is not in the word. They lose 2 guesses if they guess a vowel - a , e , i , o , u- that is not in the word.
